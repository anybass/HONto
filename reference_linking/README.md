# Context-Aware Legal Reference Linking using Topic Models

Here, new content is being created for our JURIX 2019 paper on legal reference linking called *ERST: Leveraging Topic Features for Context-Aware Legal Reference Linking*.

Currently, you find the code for:
* Reference extraction used in the UIMA Ruta Plugin for Eclipse 
* Topic modeling
* Entity resolution

More scripts, a quick start guide and trained models will be uploaded soon. Please note that we cannot upload information regarding the corpus of 193 books we used due to copyright held by the owners.
